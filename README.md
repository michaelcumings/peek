## Description

Our project is “Peek,” a social photo sharing app designed to emphasize geographic relationships by placing location-based browsing at the center of the UI.

Most photo sharing services such as Google Photos enable geotagging, but this information is only visible once you’re already viewing a piece of content. It isn’t made useful for people interested in exploring a neighborhood or a region. Instagram allows users to browse a location that has already been used as a geotag, but this does not surface other nearby locations. Google Maps allows users to share photos of businesses and other public places, but with limited detail, no discussion, and a consumerist emphasis.

By allowing users to freely browse by location and post images along with allowing for open-ended discussion, Peek encourages users to gather around unique interests. For example, a residents of a geographic region could share information about traffic hazards or infrastructure problems, architecture enthusiasts can construct virtual tours of a neighborhood, or cat lovers could share snaps of all the best cats in their area.

Per the project guidelines, our frontend will employ React and our backend will be Node/Express.js. Image storage, user authentication and database will be in Firebase.
